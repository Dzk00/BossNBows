# BossNBows

This mod add 7 bows to the game, with biome progression based on boss kill & farm, a new feature named Bow Mode & some tweaks to bow gameplay.

## News Bows

Each bow has his own effect, like a piercing shot every X attacks or some aoe features. <br>
To unlock them, you need to first defeat the boss & get some mats in the next biome. <br>
The EikthyrBow is a BlackForest bow for example.

## Extra features

 - Dash after attack, it can be disbaled via config if you don't like it.
 - 3 new bow mode : Fast, Heavy & Turret. Default keybind is G to rotate between modes (work only with a bow equiped)
